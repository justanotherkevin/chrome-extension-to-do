Daily todo list.  
Create the task to do daily and knock it out everyday.

You’ve heard the cliché that achieving a long-term goal is kind of like eating an elephant: You’ve got to do it one bite at a time.

Sometimes you just need a daily routine. Often time that is the best way to keep improving. Want to improve your mental health, do journaling everyday. Want to get better at coding interview question? Do 5 interview questions everyday.

Discipline is the most important thing one can develope to achieve your life goal.
I hope this will help you on your journey to achieve your ultimate goal.  
Lets go get it, daily.
